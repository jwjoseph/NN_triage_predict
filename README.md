This repository contains code and data for the article, "Deep-Learning Approaches to Identify Critically Ill Patients at 
Emergency Department Triage Using Limited Information"

The repository contains the original model code used to create both a two-layer dense neural network to predict critically ill patients based on vital signs, as well as for the combined neural network which predicts based on both chief complaint text embedding and vital signs.  Both neural network models are available for immediate use under an MIT license.

A modified, de-identified dataset containing normalized vital signs will be uploaded shortly for use with the code, along with sample model weights.

Pending approval, a modified, de-identified dataset containing modified chief complaint text data will also be uploaded for use with the full model.

Please check back soon for an updated dataset which will be posted in accordance with HIPAA SAFE-HARBOR criteria.
